# DNDcompanion


SUMMARY

This is a helper web app for those who play Dungeons and Dragons. It is a school project that we plan to make into a public app. 
The app is designed to fill in areas of the player sheet that are considered tedious to do by hand (calculations and other such things that are relative to the basic information, such as ability mods). The app is currently a work in progress.
